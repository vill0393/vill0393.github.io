    </header>
    <article>
    <p>Since I was a young child I developed a love for the arts, particularly drawing<br>
       which led me to study Fine Arts in my home country. After graduating I worked<br>
       primarily in the printing industry as a graphic designer. Some years after, the<br>
       oportunity to move to Canada showed up.</p>
       <p>It was in this country that I realized I needed to gain a fresh perspective on the<br>
       design industry, so I took the decision to enrolle in the <em>Interactive Media Design</em><br>
       Program at Allgonquin College. After school, I hope to succeed as a freelancer<br>
       and continue to do the things I love.
